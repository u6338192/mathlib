  --To Do
  -- * new examples which can't be solved with `library_search`
  -- * Need another non misleading example for tactics.md
  -- * print_message/message functions as an mmap?
  -- * tests must suppress output, need a silence option like in library_Search
  -- * refine list doesn't find or_true for some reason

`refine_list` is a modification of `library_search`, which lists possible usages of the `refine`
tactic and leaves the tactic state unchanged. It is intended as a complement of the search
function in your editor, the `#find` tactic, and `library_search`.
`refine_list` takes an optional natural number `num` as input and returns the first `num`
(or less, if all possibilities are exhausted) possibilities ordered by length of lemma names.
The default for `num` is `50`.
For performance reasons `refine_list` uses monadic lazy lists (`mllist`). This means that
`refine_list` might miss some results if `num` is not large enough. However, because
`refine_list` uses monadic lazy lists, smaller values of `num` run faster than larger values.
